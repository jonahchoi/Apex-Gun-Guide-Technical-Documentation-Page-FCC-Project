      <p>&emsp;Welcome to Animezer's Apex Legends Gun Guide. Apex is a fast-paced battle royale with a plethora of guns to equip. There are 7 classes of guns: assault rifles, SMGs, light machine guns, marksman rifles, snipers, shotguns, and pistols. Each category has multiple weapons with varying levels of prominence in the meta. The scope of this project will not cover every gun but will go over the stats and mechanics of the best guns in the game. I hope this guide proves useful to you and stay tuned for future updates. (This guide is for season 12).</p>

      <header class="section-header">What Guns to Choose?</header>
      <p>&emsp;While there are many guns to choose from, only a handful will be your best friends through thick and thin. You can only carry two guns at any one time so choosing the right ones to cover your bases is very important. Most people prefer to carry one medium to long range weapon and one short range. Having one of each means you can fight in any circumstance, close or far. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>R-301 and Mastiff/Peacekeeper</code></li>
        <li><code>Wingman and C.A.R.</code></li>
        <li><code>Triple-take and R-99</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&emsp;My personal favorite gun is the R301. It is very easy to use and does well in all almost all ranges, but particularly at medium ranges. To supplement this, I use either a mastiff or peacekeeper for the close range encounters. I also enjoy rocking the wingman/CAR combo for a closer range but still deadly setup. </p>
      <p>&emsp;Whatever combination of guns you choose to use, try to stick to a few to really hone your skills on each. Don't be a jack of all trades, master of none. Go into the firing range to practice recoil and flicking. It takes time to really understand get a feel for a single weapon, so use it constantly and you'll only get better.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>R301</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>The R301 is arguably the best gun in the game this season. It has always been very consistent, but with the flatline leaving the ground loot pool, the R3 has been pushed to the top. It has a very easy-to-learn recoil pattern and moderate rate-of-fire. </p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per bullet: 14</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 18/20/25/28</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 810 RPM</li>
        <br>
        <li>VK-47 Flatline</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>The flatline has a lot of recoil and a slow rate-of-fire. However, if you are able to learn the pattern and control the gun, each bullet does a lot of damage and slows the enemy with heavy bullets. Flatline is still one of the strongest guns in the game despite being put into the crafter this season.</p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per bullet: 18</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 20/25/28/30</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 600 RPM</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="SMGs" class="main-section">
      <header class="section-header">SMGs</header>
      <ul>
        <li>C.A.R.</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>The CAR has garnered popularity recently as players learn how to use it and realize its full potential. Similar to the flatline, once players learn the harsh recoil, the damage output is insane. The CAR has higher damage per mag than its competitor, the R-99, with only a slight decrease in firerate. I consider the CAR to currently be the best SMG in the game. </p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per bullet: 13</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 20/22/24/27</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 930 RPM</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per mag(purple): 351</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Shotguns" class="main-section">
      <header class="section-header">Shotguns</header>
      <code class="code">The mastiff and peacekeeper are both very good and it is up to personal preference which you choose. </code>
        
      <ul>
        <li>Mastiff</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>The mastiff is much more forgiving than its brother, the PK. It has a faster fire-rate and holds 1 more bullet, but has slightly less damage per shot. It also has a wider spread, allowing you to hit more often. You should use this shotgun if your aim is not perfect. Reloading loads one bullet at a time, which may help when you just need that one shot to kill. </p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per shot: 88(11x8)</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 6</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 66 RPM</li>
        <li>Peacekeeper</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>The peacekeeper does more damage per shot, but requires better aim and consistency. Shooting a shot puts you in a cocking animation so whiffing will likely lead to death. Use this shotgun if you have good aim.  </p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per shot: 99(9x11)</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 5</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 55 RPM</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Pistols" class="main-section">
      <header class="section-header">Pistols</header>
        <code>There's basically only one usable pistol in the game.</code>
      <ul>
      
        <li>Wingman</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet"><p>Although the wingman is a mere pistol, it is one of the best (and most challenging) guns in the game. Each bullet does big damage and doesn't use a ton of ammo. However, aim is extremely important with this weapon because there is no spray or spread. You either hit your shots or you don't. Simple as that.</p></li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Damage per bullet: 45</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Magazine size: 6/7/8/9</li>
        <li class="indented-bullet">Rate of fire: 156 RPM</li>
      </ul>
